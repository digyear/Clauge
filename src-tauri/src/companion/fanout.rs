// PTY fan-out: one hub per live terminal, mirroring its byte stream to
// any number of companion WebSocket subscribers while keeping a 256KB
// scrollback ring for replay-on-attach. The hubs live in module-level
// statics (same shape as cloud/scheduler.rs) because the publishers are
// the PTY reader threads / russh tasks, which have no AppHandle.
//
// Resize rule (phone-always-wins while attached): whenever a phone is
// attached and has reported a valid size, the shared PTY adopts the
// PHONE's fit size (smallest fits all phones). Desktop focus does NOT
// influence the size. The desktop reclaims its size only when every phone
// has left (after a detach grace that holds the last phone size so a quick
// reconnect doesn't churn). All size application + the client size-echo
// flow through `reconcile`, the single chokepoint: it diffs the desired
// size against the applied size and, when they differ, resizes the real
// PTY master through the terminal registry, broadcasts a `FanoutEvent::Size`
// so every client renders at it, and emits a `terminal-size` Tauri event so
// the desktop frontend adopts the applied size. The PTY resize + broadcasts
// NEVER run under the hubs lock.
